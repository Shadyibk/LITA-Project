## Project Title: Data Entry

## Project Overview
### Data Entry is the process of entering into a computer database and updating information. When working with Excel, we need to know how to manage and how to undo data entries. As an Analyst, data can come in different formats which might be analysis ready or not, depending on how the data are handled. However, you might have to create template for people to manage data entry and to comply with whatever formatting you have applied to that template.
