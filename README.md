## Project Title: Data Entry

## Project Overview
### Data Entry is the process of entering into a computer database and updating information. When working with Excel, we need to know how to manage and how to undo data entries. As an Analyst, data can come in different formats which might be analysis ready or not, depending on how the data are handled. However, you might have to create template for people to manage data entry and to comply with whatever formatting you have applied to that template.

## Data Sources
### The primary sources of data used here is (dataset CSV) and this is an open-source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source. So we have google dataset search, open data network or any other data repository site.

## Tools Used
### Microsoft Excel for 
### i.	Data cleaning 
### ii.	Analysis and 
### iii.	Validation
### SQL – Structured Query Language for querying of data
### Github – for portfolio building
### Power BI – for reporting data

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
###  In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we will perform the following actions:
### i.	Data loading inspection
### ii.	Handling missing variables
### iii.	Data cleaning and formatting 

## Data Validation
### It helps to validate entries that go into the cells, placing some levels of control on the entries e.g. the amount column must not be less than 100.
